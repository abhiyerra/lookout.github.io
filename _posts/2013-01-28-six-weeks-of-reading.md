A little over 6 weeks ago, a number of flyers started appearing in the Lookout HQ
bathroom. Named "Uncle John's Bathroom Reader" (after [John
Hering](https://twitter.com/johnhering), Lookout's CEO), the reader contains a
single page of software engineering tips and tricks.

Modeled after [Google's Testing on the
Toilet](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2007/01/introducing-testing-on-toilet.html)
newsletter, Uncle John's Bathroom Reader aims to help raise baseline of
institutional knowledge across Lookout Engineering.

After nearly 6 continuous weeks of the reader, the issues are ready for
publication:

 * [RSpec Basics 1](/files/UJBR-01-rspec-basics-1.pdf)
 * [RSpec Basics 2](/files/UJBR-02-rspec-basics-2.pdf)
 * [Reusable RSpec 1](/files/UJBR-03-reusable-rspec.pdf)
 * [Dependencies, Gems and Bundler](/files/UJBR-04-ruby-bundler.pdf)
 * [Testing Every Commit 1](/files/UJBR-05-test-automation.pdf)
 * [RSpec Basics 3](/files/UJBR-06-rspec-basics-3.pdf)


I hope you find the issues as useful as we have.
