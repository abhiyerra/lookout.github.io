This week is a busy social week for Lookout Engineering, and also a good
opportunity for track down a real live Lookout hacker, in the wild!


* [Velocity 2012](http://velocityconf.com/velocity2012)
* [DevOps Days 2012 Mountain View](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2012-mountainview/)
* [Google I/O 2012](https://developers.google.com/events/io/)


You'll be able to find a variety of engineers at each of the events with the
highest density of Lookout hackers attending Google I/O.

See you around!
